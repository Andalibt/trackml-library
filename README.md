Tracking machine learning challenge (TrackML) utility library
=============================================================

A small library to simplify working with the dataset of the tracking machine
learning challenge.

Usage
-----

To just use the package it can be installed directly as a user package via

    pip install --user <path/to/repository>

To make a local checkout of the repository available directly it can also be
installed in a development mode

    pip install --user --editable .

In both cases, the package can be imported via `import trackml` without
additional configuration. In the later case, changes made to the code are
immediately visible without having to reinstall the package.
